# Arch Linux ARM docker images
This repository provides Dockerfiles for creating Arch Linux ARM Docker images without any external script or dependency. It uses the official Alpine image to run `pacstrap` and generate Arch Linux ARM Docker images.

Currently, only arm64 architecture is supported. However, I plan to add support for armv7h in the future.
